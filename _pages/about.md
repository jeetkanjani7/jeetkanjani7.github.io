My name is Jeet Kanjani. I am a student in [Master of Science in Computer Vision (MSCV)](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/education/academic-programs/master-of-science-computer-vision/) at the School of Computer Science, [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/), advised by Prof [Deva Ramanan]((http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~deva/)). I interned with the Metropolis team at NVIDIA AI over the last summer. Prior to joining CMU, I was a Research Engineer at [Oxehealth](https://www.oxehealth.com/) for two years based in the beautiful city of Oxford. During my bachelors, I interned and collaborated with [Torr Vision Group](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~tvg/) at the University of Oxford where I was supervised by Dr [Stuart Golodetz](http://research.gxstudios.net/) and Dr [Stephen Hicks](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news-and-events/find-an-expert/dr-stephen-hicks).
