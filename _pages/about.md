My name is Jeet Kanjani. I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer at [Meta](https://ai.meta.com/), where I focus on training and inference optimization for multimodal foundation models powering ranking across Facebook and Instagram. Before Meta, I lead optimizations for video models powering [Just Walk Out](https://justwalkout.com/) technology at AWS. 

I hold a Master of Science in Computer Vision (MSCV) from the School of Computer Science, [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/), where I was advised by [Prof. Deva Ramanan](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~deva/). During my time at CMU, I interned with the Metropolis team at [NVIDIA AI](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/), working on video understanding.

Prior to CMU, I worked as a Research Engineer at [Oxehealth](https://www.oxehealth.com/) for two years in Oxford, focusing on camera-based vital sign monitoring. During my undergraduate studies, I collaborated with the [Torr Vision Group](https://torrvision.com/) at the University of Oxford, under the supervision of [Dr. Stuart Golodetz](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~stuart/) and [Dr. Stephen Hicks](https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/team/stephen-hicks).
