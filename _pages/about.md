My name is Jeet Kanjani. I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer at Meta, where I focus on training and inference optimization for multimodal foundation models powering ranking across Facebook and Instagram. Before Meta, I lead optimizations for video models powering Just Walk out models at Amazon. 

I hold a Master of Science in Computer Vision (MSCV) from the School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by Prof. Deva Ramanan. During my time at CMU, I interned with the Metropolis team at NVIDIA AI, working on video understanding at scale.

Prior to CMU, I worked as a Research Engineer at Oxehealth for two years in Oxford, focusing on camera-based vital sign monitoring. During my undergraduate studies, I collaborated with the Torr Vision Group at the University of Oxford, under the supervision of Dr. Stuart Golodetz and Dr. Stephen Hicks.
