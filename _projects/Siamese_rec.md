The problem of arbitrary object tracking has traditionally
been tackled by learning a model of the objectâ€™s appearance and mo-
tion during the online phase. We quip a basic tracking algorithm using
a Siamese network composed of fully convolutional network which incor-
porates a recurrent layer at the end. The convolutional recurrent model
learns a motion model and leveraging the power of Siamese network helps
in achieving robust tracking. The network is trained end to end on IL-
VRSC17 for similarity learning in videos.
