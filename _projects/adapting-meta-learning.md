=============
The problem of learning to generalize from limited examples at test time is referred to as few shot learning. 
Although, there have been few shot learning algorithms which have reported performance better than the state of the art, there is a lack of domain shift between the source and target domain as the novel classes used in those cases are sampled from the same dataset. This makes the current evaluation numbers flawed.
